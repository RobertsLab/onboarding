### My Mentoring Approach
My mentoring approach will be somewhat specific per student, however generally I view my role as providing you the resources to succeed in **your** educational experience. There will be regular lab meetings where we primarily address any challenges members might be having while reaching their goals. Goals are important and I will working with you in developing long-term goals, however you will need to have monthly goals. You might not always achieve them, but this help you stay focused. Beyond lab meeting I have established a [number means of communication]().
Utmostly important as you get into research, is to communicate issues and challenges. I will work with you to address, though often we might find that the most effective solutions are resources outside of the lab. 
I will provide honest feedback in an effort to push you to be your best including consistently stepping back to re-evaluate your work in a larger context, and consider areas of improvement.
