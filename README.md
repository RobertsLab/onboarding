## Onboarding to the [Roberts Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).


### My Mentoring Approach
My mentoring approach will be somewhat specific per student, however generally I view my role as providing you the resources to succeed in **your** educational experience. There will be regular lab meetings where we primarily address any challenges members might be having while reaching their goals. Goals are important and I will working with you in developing long-term goals, however you will need to develop monthly goals. You might not always achieve them, but this helps you stay focused. Beyond lab meetings we have established a [number means of communication](https://github.com/RobertsLab/onboarding/wiki/Communication). 

Utmostly important as you get into research, is to communicate issues and challenges. I will work with you to address, though often we might find that the most effective solutions are resources outside of the lab. 

I will provide honest feedback in an effort to push you to be your best. This will include  pushing you to consistently be stepping back to re-evaluate your work in a larger context, and consider areas of improvement. 


### Expectations of Students
Graduate school is not easy, and not for everyone. Graduate school will be very challenging, and for most, very rewarding. Graduate school is not a job where you check-in and check-out each day, but rather an educational endevour where you gain a deep understanding of a scientific area and complete your tenure by contributing a valuable research product, that substantially advances knowledge. Understanding this fact might help you deal with the challenges and frustrations you will face.    

Everyone will follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/RobertsLab/onboarding/wiki/Code-of-Conduct). Following this will contribute to a environment to succeed. 

There is a lot going on during your graduate education. Staying organized and not overwhelmed is key. In the same vein, time-management is key. There are several stategies for this. I suggest reading "Getting Things Done".

A lot of our research [involves computational analysis](https://github.com/RobertsLab/onboarding/wiki/Computing) of large, novel datasets. You will need to be competent in computing skills including basics of bash and R. A common task you should be able to accomplish is installing and running Blast on your own computer. You should also be familiar with Jupyter Notebooks. As might be evident, we using GitHub extensively and you will be using this to document code and data (and everything else).

Electronic Open Lab Notebooks are also central to the lab. You will be required to document your activity _in real time_. This will include not only benchwork and computational work, but also reflections, questions, and monthly goals. Work 

Writing. Always be doing it. Do not wait until you have completed a project but rather write the methods as you carry them out (or preferably before). This goes hand in hand with the lab notebook. Document your work in a detail that you and I can completely reproduce it in 5 years. 


This should be enough to know what you have gotten in to. 
There is a lot more stuff to delve into in the [wiki](https://github.com/RobertsLab/onboarding/wiki).
