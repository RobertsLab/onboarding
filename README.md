Please visit [the wiki page of the onboarding repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/onboarding/wiki) for lots of good information. I will address aspects on philosophies and expectations below. This repo was inspired by xxx,xx and a similar document generated by Tim Essington. 


### My Mentoring Approach
My mentoring approach will be somewhat specific per student, however generally I view my role as providing you the resources to succeed in **your** educational experience. There will be regular lab meetings where we primarily address any challenges members might be having while reaching their goals. Goals are important and I will working with you in developing long-term goals, however you will need to have monthly goals. You might not always achieve them, but this help you stay focused. Beyond lab meeting I have established a [number means of communication]().    

Utmostly important as you get into research, is to communicate issues and challenges. I will work with you to address, though often we might find that the most effective solutions are resources outside of the lab.    

I will provide honest feedback in an effort to push you to be your best including consistently stepping back to re-evaluate your work in a larger context, and consider areas of improvement.


### Expectations of Students
Graduate school is not easy, and not for everyone. Graduate school will be very challenging, and for most very rewarding. Graduate school is not a job where you check-in and check-out each day, an educational endevour where you gain a deep understanding of a scientific area and complete your tenure by contributing a valuable research product that substantially advances knowledge. Understanding this might help you deal with the challenges and frustrations you will face.
